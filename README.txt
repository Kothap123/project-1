To design a command-line tool that can query the Merriam-Webster dictionary and return the definition of a word, we can follow the following steps:


1.Install necessary packages: We will use the requests package to make HTTP requests and the BeautifulSoup package to parse the HTML response.

2.Define a function that takes a word as an argument and queries the Merriam-Webster dictionary using the requests package.

3.Parse the HTML response using the BeautifulSoup package to extract the definition of the word.

4.Return the formatted response to the user.

To use the tool, the user can run the script from the command line with the word they want to define as an argument. For example, running the command python dictionary.py exercise will return the output.


If the word is not found in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the tool will return a message indicating that no definition was found for the word.

Taking ahead after the python code development if it needs to be built using jenkins pipeline I think below approach can actually help you to achieve the target.

1.Install necessary packages: We will need to install the requests and BeautifulSoup packages to make HTTP requests and parse the HTML response.

2.We already have a Python script that defines a function to query the Merriam-Webster dictionary and return the definition of a word.

3.And then we create a Jenkins pipeline that includes the following steps:

a. Checkout the source code from the Git repository where the Python script is stored.

b. Install necessary dependencies (requests and BeautifulSoup) using a virtual environment.

c. Run the command-line tool with the word to define passed as an argument.

d. Capture the output of the command-line tool and display it in the Jenkins console.


In the Jenkins file that was attached we have a Package stage creates an artifact by copying the executable file to a new directory called artifacts. This directory can be used to store all runtime artifacts for this project.
note that in the Build stage, we use the PyInstaller package to build the command-line tool into a standalone executable. This requires specifying the --onefile flag to create a single executable file. This stage should produce a file called dictionary in the dist directory.
Dockerfile defines a Docker image based on the Python 3.9 slim-buster image, copies the current directory to the /app directory in the image, installs the requirements from the requirements.txt file, and sets the command to run the dictionary.py file.
